# East_Coast_General_Hospital_EMR
East Coast General Hospital (fictional), located in the heart of Philadelphia, is a 500-bed hospital that staffs a team of well-trained medical professionals of varying specialties, 
including 50 doctors and 100 nurses who work hard to serve their local community. Due to a spike in patient visits over this past year (around 5,000 more than the previous year), 
the hospital has decided to upgrade from their traditional paper files to a more robust electronic medical record system that will improve efficiency and keep up with the increasing demand. 
The hospital has asked us, Team East Coast, to help with this transition. 

Our web-based, database-driven EMR (Electronic Medical Record System) will capture each patient encounter in accurate detail and have these records accessible by patients and their care teams hospital-wide, in real-time. 
The database captures people such as Doctors, Nurses and Patients as entities and they are related to the Rooms they stay in or care for and Departments they belong to. A Patient may be 
encountered by a Doctor and assisted by multiple Nurses in a Visit in a Room for medical examination, and may be required for additional lab tests and examinations, which is recorded through the Requisition.

The project uses simple handlebars to create static pages for front end UI with data stored and accessed through SQL queries and performing CRUD operations.
